Hi! this project was a short driving at maximizing the capacity for property owners to maximize their location's Airbnb
or short term rental rates. It uses data from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. A random forest regressor was employed to determine an optimal rate. The application also uses a rudimentary login system, an external PostgreSQL hookup, 
and a profile page. 

Dig in to your hearts content!
